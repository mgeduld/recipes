## Burgers

Makes 4. Worth doubling. 

### INGREDIENTS

* 1 cup grated zucchini (about one small/medium zucchini)
* ½ cup pecans, minced (measure after mincing)
* 1 – 15 oz. can black beans, drained and rinsed
* 1 Tablespoon flax meal (ground flaxseed)
* 1 Tablespoon tamari
* 2 Tablespoons tomato paste
* ¼ teaspoon liquid smoke
* 1 Tablespoon miso *
* ½ cup panko bread crumbs *(see notes)
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 2 Tablespoons dried minced onion flakes
* ¼ to ½ teaspoon red pepper flake
* ¼ teaspoon ground mustard
* ¼ teaspoon coriander
* ¼ teaspoon paprika
* ¼ teaspoon black pepper

### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 350 F.
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, set aside.
3. Place the pecans into the food processor and pulse until you have a fine crumb mixture. Note: The ½ cup (packed) measurement is after the pecans have been processed.  Place in the large bowl. (You do not need to clean the food processor in between steps).
4. Next place the rinsed and drain black beans into the food processor and coarsely chop, then place into the large bowl with the pecans.
5. Switch from the “S” blade in the food processor to the grater attachment (or hand grate using a box grater), grate 1 cup of zucchini (no need to peel). Place the grated zucchini into fine mesh strainer and push the water out of it. Then place the zucchini into a 1 cup measuring cup and press down hard several times, tilting the cup so the water drains out over the sink. Excess liquid will release from the grated zucchini and drain into the sink. Keep pressing until you measure ½ cup of grated zucchini, then add to the bowl.
6. Next add all the remaining ingredients and spices into the bowl and mix well. This may take a minute or so to full incorporate all the ingredients, then the mixture should easily pull together into one large clump.
7. Use the ½ measuring cup to measure out 4 burgers, then roll the burger mixture into 4 tightly compact balls, then shape the balls into flat burger disks measuring approx. 3 ½ to 4 inches in diameter, and place them onto the parchment lined baking sheet. Place into a preheated 350 F oven and bake for 20 minutes, then flip over and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
8. Remove from the oven and allow to sit for 5 minutes to set up before serving.
