* 14 ounce can black beans
* 14 ounce can pinto beans
* 1 1/2 teaspoon cumin
* tortillas of your choice

### Red Sauce
* 14 ounce can chopped fire roasted tomatoes
* 6 ounce can tomato paste
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

### Cheese Sauce
* 1/2 cup cashews
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
* 1 tablespoon dijon mustard
* 1 teaspoon onion powder
* 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
* 1 tsp Braggs liquid aminos or low sodium soy sauce
* 1 cup water

## Instructions
1. Sauté the onions and mushrooms until the onions are translucent.
2. Add the cabbage and peppers and cook until the cabbage is almost soft.
3. Add the red sauce ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth. Pour into a bowl and set aside.
4. Add the beans, cumin and 1 cup of the red sauce to the sautéd mixture and cook for 5 minutes.
5. Add all of the cheese ingredients to the blender and blend until smooth.
6. Spoon a couple spoonfuls of the filling onto a tortilla and roll into a burrito.
7. Place the burrito in the bottom end of a large casserole dish.
8. Continue filling tortillas and lining them up in the bottom in the pan until it is full.
9. Pour the red sauce over the burritos and smooth it with a spoon.
10. Slowly pour all of the cheese sauce over the burritos allowing it to run over the ends of the burritos. The sauce will be a bit runny.
11. Bake at 350° for 50 minutes.
12. Serve each enchilada with your favorite toppings. Our favorites are guacamole, salsa and yogurt sauce. (yogurt sauce is a cup yogurt from my yogurt recipe, 1/2 tsp onion powder, teaspoon lemon juice and 1/2 tsp Braggs)
