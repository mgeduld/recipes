* 1 cup rolled oats, pulsed in food processor
* ½-1 cup rolled oats, as needed

## Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 400℉.
2. Saute the onions, carrots, celery, and mushrooms until tender and most of the liquid is cooked off.
3. Add the saute mixture and the rest of the ingredients into a large bowl and mix very well until incorporated. Add enough rolled oats to create a dry mixture.
4. Scoop the mixture out into a 4x3 silicone muffin pan.
5. Bake for 45 minutes or until solid.
