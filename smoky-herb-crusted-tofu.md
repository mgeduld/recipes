# Smoky Herb-Crusted Tofu

I cook this on a coutertop grill. The one I own is the [Griddler](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-GR-4N-Griddler-Silver-Black/dp/B002YD99Y4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=gridler&qid=1612784125&sr=8-1), but you could use any brand. 

## Ingredients 

* 1 x 14 to 16oz package of Extra Firm Tofu
* 1/2 cup reduced sodium vegetable broth (or 1/2 cup of hot water combined with 1/2 tsp Better Than Bouillon Organic Reduced Sodium Seasoned Vegetable Base)
* 1/2 tsp liquid smoke
* 4 tsp Bragg liquid aminos (or substitute low sodium soy sauce)
* 1 Tbsp poultry seasoning (salt-free)

##Directions 

1. Freeze your unopened block of tofu overnight and let thaw. We usually just store our tofu in the freezer and then move it to the fridge for thawing a few days before we want to cook it. Freezing it creates a nice firm, chewy texture and also helps it soak up more marinade!
2. Once your tofu is thawed, drain off the liquid. If you have a tofu press, press your tofu for 20-30 minutes and slice into eight equal pieces. If you don’t have a press, we prefer to slice ours into eight equal pieces FIRST and then press it between paper or tea towels sandwiched between two cutting boards with something heavy on top. Either way, you need to press the tofu for about 20-30 minutes to get as much moisture out as possible.
3. While the tofu is pressing, put all of the remaining ingredients into a bowl and whisk to combine.
4. Once the tofu is pressed and sliced into eight equal pieces, carefully lay it into a gallon-size Ziploc bag in a single layer. Add your marinade to the bag and seal it shut, squeezing out as much air as possible. We like to press the tofu a bit with our hands at this point to help the marinade absorb into the tofu. Refrigerate overnight or for at least 8 hours.
5. Make sure you have the grill plates installed on your Griddler. Switch the “Selector” knob to “Grill-Panini” and turn the “Grill-Panini” temperature knob to “Sear.”
6. Once the Griddler is heated up (for our model, a light on the “Grill-Panini” knob turns on when it is ready), carefully place your marinated tofu slices diagonally on the grill plates. We usually cook no more than four pieces at a time. Close the Griddler and cook on “Sear” for 5 minutes.
7. After 5 minutes, check on the tofu. If any pieces are sticking, use tongs to gently loosen them up.
8. Close and grill for an additional 5 minutes or until desired “doneness” is reached!
