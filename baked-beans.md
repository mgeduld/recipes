## Ingredients:
* 1 onion, diced small
* 5 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
* 1 ½ teaspoons smoked paprika
* ½ - 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 1 teaspoon mustard powder
* 1 teaspoon chipotle powder
* ¼ teaspoon white pepper
* 1 tablespoon Well Your World Voodoo Cajun Seasoning Blend
* 1 teaspoon liquid smoke (optional)
* 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
* 1 6 oz can of tomato paste
* 4 cans pinto beans, with liquid
* 1 ½ cups pineapple (or try mango/dates), minced (~10 ounces)
* fresh chopped cilantro to top
	
## Instructions

1. Add the onions to the pot first, browning them by dry sauteing without adding too much water.
2. Once the onions are browned, add everything else (except the cilantro) to the pot and bring to a boil.
3. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let cook for about 30 minutes or more.This allows for the flavors and textures to come together into the perfect baked beans.
4. Garnish with cilantro, serve, and enjoy!

NOTE: much better after sitting in the fridge overnight.
