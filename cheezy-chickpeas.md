Cheezy chickpeas!

Source: https://community.plantstrong.com/posts/cheezy-chickpeas

Ingredients:
- 1 15-ounce can no salt added or low sodium chickpeas (do not drain and rinse!)
- 1/2 cup nutritional yeast
- 1 teaspoons Bragg liquid aminos
- 1 tablespoon whole wheat flour

Directions:
1. Drain the liquid from the canned chickpeas into a small saucepan. Add the Bragg liquid aminos, then whisk in the nutritional yeast and whole wheat flour until well combined. Simmer on medium heat until mixture thickens, stirring constantly. Remove from heat, add chickpeas and stir to cover.
2. Serve over cooked brown rice, baked potatoes, whole wheat pasta or your favorite grain â€“ and load it up with some fresh or steamed greens!

PRO Tip: add other cumin and cayenne to make this nacho cheezy, garlic and oregano to make it pizza cheezy, or smoked paprika to make it smoky cheezy.

Servings: 2

Notes: I added a teaspoon each of oregano and garlic powder. I also found that when I was done whisking in the nutritional yeast and flour, it was already thick. I went ahead and simmered it for a couple of minutes, just to say I'd done so, but I'm not sure that was necessary, though it was nice eating it warm.
