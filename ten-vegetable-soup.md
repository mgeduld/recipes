## Ingredients:
###Veggies:
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 1/2 cup carrot, sliced
- 1/2 cup celery, sliced
- 1/2 red bell pepper, diced
- 1/2 yellow bell pepper, diced
- 1/2 poblano pepper, seeded, diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced

**Use the peppers you like and have available. Don’t want a half a pepper lying around? Use a whole red or yellow or poblano.)

### Spices:
- 1/2 tablespoon cumin
- 1/2 tablespoon paprika
- 1/2 tablespoon rosemary
- 1/2 tablespoon basil
- 1 teaspoons Himalayan salt (I used 2 tbsp of tamari instead, added with liquid)
- 1 teaspoons white pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 bay leaf

### Other ingredients:

- 1/2 cup dry Barley (rinsed off)
- 1 tablespoons tomato paste
- 6 cups veggie stock
- 1 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 1 tablespoons reduced sodium soy sauce
- 1 tablespoons chia seeds (10g)
- 15-ounce can garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed (425g) 
- 1 15-ounce cans fire roasted tomatoes
- 1/4 cup frozen green peas
- 15oz frozen corn (or 15-ounce can frozen fire roasted corn)
- 1 bag chopped frozen spinach (or about 3 cups of chopped fresh spinach) 
- 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice

## Directions:
1. Cook the dry barley first. 
2. Start by rinsing the dry barley under cold water until it is clear and free of dust and its clean. 
3. Toss the barely into a clean Instant Pot and add 1 cup of filtered water. 
4. It’s a 2:1 ratio for dry barely to water in the IP.  
5. Cook on manual high pressure for 15 mins with a quick release after its been done for 10 minutes.  
6. Put the barley in a bowl or container and set aside. 
7. In a clean and empty Instant pot, add a few tablespoons or water or veggie broth to the Instant Pot on the saute setting
8. Then add all the veggies from the veggies list. 
9. Sweat the vegetables until they have softened, about 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
10. After the veggies have softened, add all the spices except the bay leaves to the pot and stir constantly for 30 seconds to activate the spices. 
11. Add the tomato paste, cook for 4 to 5 minutes and keep stirring until the paste begins to darken and starts to caramelize. 
12. Next, add 1/2 cup of vegetable stock and scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to scrape off any bits that are stuck to the bottom. This is the flavor. 
13. Add the cooked barley and the rest of the ingredients except the spinach and lime juice. 
14. Stir to combine. (And add in 2 tbsp Tamari.)
15. Lock the lid on the pressure cooker and set the time for 3 minutes.
16. After the cooking time finishes, allow the pressure to come down naturally. 
17. Once you can unlock the lid, open the pot and stir in the spinach. 
18. You may want to set the lid back on the cooker just to retain the heat as the spinach heats through or wilts. 
19. Taste the soup and adjust any spices if needed.
20. Add the lime juice, and stir one last time. Pour into soup bowls. Enjoy.
