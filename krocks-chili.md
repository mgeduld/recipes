# Krock's Chili

This is the best chili I've ever tasted. I tend to cut the recipe in half and just throw all the ingredients into the Instant Pot (on the Chili setting)


Ingredients

– 2 to 3 medium red onions (approx. 3-4 cups when diced)
– 2 to 3 green peppers (approx. 3-4 cups when diced)
– 3 tsp chopped garlic OR 5-6 cloves fresh garlic, minced
– 1 x 6oz can tomato paste (no salt added if possible)
– 2 x 14.5 oz cans diced tomatoes (no salt added if possible)
– 1 x 28oz can crushed tomatoes (no salt added if possible)
– 4 cups reduced sodium vegetable broth (or 4 cups of hot water combined with 4 tsp Better Than Bouillon Organic Reduced Sodium Seasoned Vegetable Base)
– 1/3 cup chili powder
– 1/4 cup mushroom powder (OPTIONAL; We blend up these dried portabella mushrooms in our spice grinder)
– 1 Tbsp cumin
– 2 Tbsp smoked paprika
– 2 tsp cinnamon
– 1 tsp nutmeg
– 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
– 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
– 1 tsp salt (OPTIONAL)
– 8 x 15oz cans of beans (drained & rinsed; we use a mix of kidney, pinto, black & cannellini) OR 36oz dry beans that have been pre-cooked
– 2 cups frozen corn
– 8oz red split lentils, rinsed & drained (these do NOT need to be pre-cooked)
Directions

1. Dice the onions and peppers (approx. 1/2 inch dice).
2. Heat a large stockpot to medium-high. Water sauté the diced onions and peppers for about 5 minutes, until they just begin to soften, adding a splash of hot water as needed.
3. Add the garlic and cook for about one minute, until fragrant.
4. Add the tomato paste (and a splash of hot water if needed), stir to combine and reduce heat to medium.
5. Add the remaining ingredients and stir.
6. Cover and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally.
7. Once at a simmer, reduce heat to medium/low, depending on your stove. Cover and simmer for about 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until your lentils are cooked.
This recipe makes approximately 6 quarts (24 cups) of chili. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 4 days or in the freezer for several months.
