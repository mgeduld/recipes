## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups water
* 1 1/2 cups unsweetened soy, hemp or almond milk
* 1 tablespoon whole wheat flour or arrowroot powder
* 1 tablespoon [Dr. Fuhrman's VegiZest](https://shop.drfuhrman.com/organic-vegizest-salt-free-seasoning/) or other no-salt seasoning, adjusted to taste
* 1 teaspoon Braggs Liquid Aminos
* 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 medium white or sweet potato, peeled and diced
* 1 large carrot, peeled and diced (I like adding lots of extra carrots, maybe 6 or 7)
* 1/2 medium onion, diced
* 1/2 medium red bell pepper, chopped
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1 1/4 cups fresh or frozen corn kernels
* 5 cups baby kale or spinach
* ground black pepper to taste

## Instructions

Note: I don't follow the instructions, below. I just dump all the ingredients into an Instant Pot and put it on the soup setting. 

1. In a soup pot, begin to heat water and non-dairy milk over low heat. 
2. Whisk in the flour, VegiZest, Braggs and cayenne pepper. 
3. Bring to a simmer and add the potato, carrot, onion, red bell pepper, and garlic. 
4. Cover and continue to simmer for 20 minutes, or until vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. 
5. Add the corn and heat until the soup comes to a simmer again. 
6. Add baby kale or spinach and cook until the greens are wilted. 
7. Season with black pepper.
