From the [How Not to Die Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Diet-Cookbook-Permanent/dp/1250199255/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2O4WV8S6LXMSY&dchild=1&keywords=how+not+to+die+cookbook&qid=1612784771&sprefix=How+not+to+die%2Caps%2C178&sr=8-1). It is creamy and flavorful. Serve it as a dipping sauce for fresh cut veggies, or on salads

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup raw cashews (*soaked for 3 hours and drained)
* 2 cloves Roasted Garlic (Recipe below.)
* 1/2 tablespoon smooth raw almond butter
* 1/2 cup water
* 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* 2 teaspoons blended peeled lemon
* 1 tablespoon red onion chopped
* 2 teaspoons Savory Spice Blend (Recipe below)
* 1 teaspoon white miso paste
* 3/4 teaspoon date sugar (or 1 pitted date, chopped)
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley
* 1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill or 1/2 teaspoon dried

## Instructions:

1. In a high-speed blender, combine all the ingredients except the parsley and dill, and blend until smooth. Transfer the dressing to a bowl and stir in the parsley and dill. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed. (The flavor will get stronger as the dressing sits.)
2. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour to allow the flavors to develop. Stir or shake before serving.

## Roasted Garlic

Easy to prepare, roasted garlic adds incredible bursts of flavor to recipes and makes a great spread on toast or sandwiches.

### Ingredients
* 1 whole head of garlic or more

### Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400F.
2. Use a sharp knife to cut about 1‚ÅÑ3 inch off the top of a whole garlic head to expose the tops of the garlic cloves. Wrap the garlic head in parchment paper or place in a small covered baking dish, cut side up, and place in the oven. If roasting more than one head of garlic, arrange them, cut side up, in a covered baking dish, or place each head in a separate well of a muffin pan and cover with an inverted cookie sheet.
3. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the garlic cloves are soft and golden brown. 
4. Remove from the oven and uncover to let the garlic cool. When the garlic is cool to the touch, gently squeeze each clove individually over a small bowl, allowing the soft, roasted garlic to slip out of the papery skin. (If it is not very soft and golden brown, it needs to be covered or rewrapped in the parchment and baked a few minutes longer.) 
5. Enjoy the roasted garlic immediately or store it in the refrigerator in a jar or other container with a tight-fitting lid.

## Spicy Savory Blend

I always have this seasoning blend on hand to add flavor to dishes in place of salt.

### Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast 
* 1 tablespoon onion powder
* 1 tablespoon dried parsley
* 1 tablespoon dried basil
* 2 teaspoons dried thyme
* 2 teaspoons garlic powder
* 2 teaspoons dry mustard (mustard powder)
* 2 teaspoons paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
* 1/2 teaspoon celery seeds

### Instructions
Combine all the ingredients in a spice grinder or blender to mix well and pulverize the dried herbs and spices. Transfer the blend to a shaker bottle or jar with a tight-fitting lid. Store in a cool, dry place.
