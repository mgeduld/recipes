## Ingredients
* 1 large yellow onion, diced into 1/2-inch pieces (approx. 2 cups when diced)
* 2 large Poblano peppers, seeds removed, diced into 1/4-inch pieces (approx. 2 cups when diced)
* 1 Tbsp minced garlic
* 1 Tbsp nutritional yeast
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp chili powder
* 1 tsp Mexican oregano *see note
* 1/2 tsp white pepper
* 4 cups reduced sodium veggie stock (we use 4 tsp Better Than Bouillon mixed w/ 4 cups of hot water)
* 3 x 15oz cans white cannellini beans (no salt added if possible), drained & rinsed
* 1/2 cup frozen corn
* 4oz Butler soy curls
* 1 x 12oz block soft silken tofu
* 1/2 cup plain, unsweetened almond milk
* 1 Tbsp white miso paste
* 2 Tbsp lime juice + extra for serving

* 3 tbs Tamari (my addition)

## Directions
1. Heat a large pot or Dutch oven to medium-high. Add diced onions and Poblano peppers. Sauté until softened, stirring constantly.
2. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 60 seconds.
3. Add nutritional yeast, cumin, chili powder, Mexican oregano and white pepper. Stir to combine.
4. Add veggie stock, tamari, beans and corn. Stir to combine.
5. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low and add soy curls. Cover and let simmer for 10-15 minutes until soy curls are softened.
6. While soup is cooking, combine silken tofu, almond milk and white miso paste in your blender and blend for 30-60 seconds until smooth. This will work best in a small blender cup (Magic Bullet or similar).
7. Once soy curls are softened, add blender mixture to the soup and stir. Heat for an additional 5-10 minutes. Stir in lime juice and serve with extra lime juice if desired.

Makes approximately 4-6 servings.

NOTE:
– If you don’t have Mexican oregano, we do NOT recommend swapping with regular oregano as it has a very different flavor. You can always just leave it out. We buy ours here and use our spice grinder to grind it.
