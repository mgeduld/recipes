## Ingredients:
### Buffalo Sauce
- 1 cup tomato sauce
- ¾ cup distilled vinegar
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- 2 dates
- ¼ cup cashews (for a creamy version, optional)

### Taquitos
- 2 cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- ½ cup buffalo sauce
- 1 celery stalk, diced
- corn tortillas

## Instructions:
1. To prepare the buffalo sauce, add all ingredients to a high speed blender and process well.
2. Preheat the oven to 350°F. (Also works in the air fryer.)
3. Add the chickpeas, buffalo sauce, and celery to a large mixing bowl. Use a fork or potato masher to mash up the mixture.
4. Add about 2 tablespoons of the mixture to a corn tortilla. Roll it up and then place it seam side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Continue until you've filled the entire sheet or run out of filling.
5. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until crispy. Serve with ranch, extra celery, and any remaining buffalo sauce for dipping.
