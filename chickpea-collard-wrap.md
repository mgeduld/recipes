Source: HTTPS://WWW.DRFUHRMAN.COM/RECIPES/2760/CHICKPEA-COLLARD-WRAPS?UTM_CAMPAIGN=RECIPE%20OF%20THE%20DAY

## Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cups cooked chickpeas or 1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added or low sodium chickpeas, drained
* 1/2 cup walnuts
* 1 teaspoon Braggs Liquid Aminos or low sodium soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon [Dr. Fuhrman's MatoZes](https://shop.drfuhrman.com/organic-matozest-salt-free-seasoning) or other no-salt seasoning blend, adjusted to taste
* 6 collard green leaves (see note)
* 1 cup shredded carrots
* 1 cup shredded red or green cabbage
* 1/4 cup chopped red onion
* 1 avocado, peeled and diced

## Instructions
1. In a food processor, pulse the chickpeas, walnuts, Braggs, lemon juice and no-salt seasoning until crumbled and similar in consistency to ground meat. 
2. Use a paring knife to shave down the thick stalk of the collard leaves to make them easier to roll. Place an equal amount of the chickpea and walnut mixture on each leaf and top with the carrots, cabbage, onion and avocado. Fold up like a burrito. 
3. If desired, serve with a no-salt, no-oil salad dressing.

Note: 100% whole grain tortillas can be substituted for the collard leaves
