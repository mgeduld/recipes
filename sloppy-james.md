# Sloppy James

## Ingredients
* 1 cup uncooked green or French lentils, rinsed and drained
* 3 cups no-salt-added or low-sodium vegetable broth
* 8 ounces tempeh with flax seeds (see note), steamed for 10 minutes
* 1 medium yellow onion, diced small
* 1 green bell pepper, diced small
* 8 ounces mushrooms, chopped
* 8 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tablespoons red wine
* 3 tablespoons chili powder
* 1 tablespoon ground cumin
* pinch of cayenne
* 2 teaspoons oregano
* 1 large bunch kale, stems removed and leaves finely chopped
* 15 ounces no-salt-added tomato sauce in BPA-free packaging
* 1/2 cup no-salt-added tomato paste in BPA-free packaging
* 3 tablespoons date paste (dates pureed with water)
* 2 tablespoons low sodium yellow mustard
* 6 (100% whole grain) sesame seed rolls (Ezekiel brand)
* shredded or whole leaf romaine

## Instructions
1. Put the lentils in a small sauce pan with the 3 cups of stock. 
2. Cover and bring to a boil. 
3. Once boiling, lower heat and simmer for about 20 minutes, until lentils are soft. Set aside.
4. In a large pan, saute the onion, green pepper, mushrooms and garlic in the red wine for about 7-10 minutes, until onions are translucent and slightly browned. 
5. Add the spices and saute a minute more. 
6. Add the kale, tomato sauce, tomato paste and simmer until the greens are tender, about 10 minutes. 
7. Add the cooked lentils, crumble in the tempeh and stir in the date paste and yellow mustard. 
8. Cook for another 10 minutes.
9. Turn the heat off and let sit for about 10 minutes, so that the flavors can mingle. 
10. Serve open-faced on toasted or untoasted buns and top with shredded romaine or whole leaf romaine.

Note: Several brands of tempeh have flax seed in them. If you cannot find one, use regular tempeh and add 2 tablespoons ground flax to the Sloppy James mixture.
