## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients:

* 1 cup almond flour
* 1 cup arrowroot flour
* 1/3 cup coconut flour
* 1 tsp sea salt
* 2 tsp active dry yeast
* 1 ½ Tbsp very finely ground chia seeds
* 2 Tbsp organic psyllium husk powder

### Wet Ingredients:

* 1 ¼ cup filtered water
* 2 tsp maple syrup (This is consumed by the yeast, which lowers the glycemic index.)
* 1 egg [1]

## Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the almond flour, arrowroot flour, coconut flour, and sea salt.
2. Heat water at 105-110 °F. Add 2 tsp of maple syrup and stir. Add the yeast and let the mixture stand for 10 minutes. The yeast should bubble or foam. If it doesn’t, start all over again.
3. Stir the finely ground chia and psyllium powder into the yeast mixture. Let it stand for 1 minute to thicken, then whisk.
4. Pour the thickened yeast-chia mixture into the dry ingredients, and mix with a wooden spoon until thick and fully combined. The dough will be slightly sticky, but workable. Knead for 1 minute.
5. Put the kneaded dough back into the bowl. Cover with a damp cloth and place in a warm spot to rise for 1 hour.
6. Preheat the oven at 425 °F with a pizza stone (or cooking sheet) inside.
7. Divide the dough into two balls. Place one of the dough balls on a square parchment paper or a cutting board. Dip your hands in water and shape the other big dough ball into small round balls. Brush with egg wash, if desired. Use a serrated knife to cut a tic-tac-toe pattern on the top.
8. Slide the prepared dough onto the preheated stone or cooking sheet. Bake for 35-40 minutes. Please note that baking time can vary; the measure of doneness is an internal temperature of 205-210 °F.
9. Let your baked goodies cool completely on a wire rack. (Not allowing the loaf to fully cool before cutting may result in a gummy interior.) Once completely cooled, slice and serve, or store in an airtight container. To re-crisp crust, toast or reheat at 375 °F for 5-10 minutes.
