## Ingredients

### Dough

* 1 cup almond flour, finely ground
* 1 cup oat flour
* 1 tablespoon flax meal
* 1 tablespoon tapioca starch
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 2 tablespoons maple syrup
* ¼ cup applesauce
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

### Fig Filling

* 6 ounces dried figs (Turkish or Black Mission), stems removed 
* 1 tablespoon lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* Pinch sea salt (optional

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Place the dried figs into a bowl and cover with boiling water. Allow them to sit in the boiling water for 10-12 minutes.  Drain and set aside.
3. For the cookie dough: In a medium size bowl, whisk almond flour, oat flour, flax meal, tapioca starch, and baking powder until thoroughly combined. Add the maple syrup, applesauce, and vanilla.  Stir until combined and a thick dough can be formed into a ball.  Divide the dough into two balls. (If the dough is too sticky, you can add a bit more oat flour to the dough or chill the dough for 1-2 hours.)
4. For the filling: To a food processor, add the drained figs, lemon juice, and vanilla. You may need to pulse early in the process, adding more speed as the figs begin to break apart. Process for 8-10 seconds until a thick paste forms.
5. Build your Fig Rolls: Place one of the cookie balls onto a piece of wax or parchment paper and shape into a log.  Lay the top sheet of wax or parchment paper over the cookie log and roll the dough into a 12 x 4 inch rectangle about ¼ inch thick. Remove the top paper and use your hands to create an even rectangle.  Place half of the fig paste down the center of the dough.  Lift up the wax paper and fold the top part up over the fig filling until the two dough edges close.  Shape and slightly flatten the roll and slice into 1 to 1 ½ inch cookies.  Place cookies onto a prepared baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining cookie dough.  Bake for 8-10 minutes or until slightly golden.
