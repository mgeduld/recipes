# Air Fryer Flautas

Source: unknown

This is a really easy, versatile recipe. It's extremely malleable and could include meat, too, for your non-vegan friends.

## Ingredients
* 1 can of black beans (no-salt)
* 1 can of pinto beans (no-salt)
* 1 can of refried beans (no-salt)
* 1 package of frozen corn 
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp chipotle chili powder
* 1 tbsp nutritional yeast

There are all sorts of other things you could add: spinach, jalapeños, taco meat ...  

## Instructions
1. In a bowl, mix together a drained can of black beans, a drained can of pinto beans, refried beans, and corn.  (I used beans with no salt added and oil-free refried beans, but you can use salt and oil if you want. It's a free country. For now.)
2. Also mix in onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, cumin, and any other spices you want. I used about a teaspoon of each, and I also added some chipotle chili powder and nutritional yeast (which adds a sort of cheesy, buttery flavor). 
3. There are all sorts of other things you could add: spinach, jalapeños, taco "meat" ...  
4. (This filling is way, way better if you let it marinate in the fridge over night than if you use it right away.)
5. Scoop some of the filling into a tortilla (I used whole-wheat tortillas, but customize as you will), roll it up[1], and stick it in the air fryer (middle rack) for six minutes at 400 degrees.  

What's really lovely is that, once you've made the filling (which takes all of five minutes), fixing a flauta involves only pulling the filling out of the fridge, scooping some of it into a tortilla, and tossing the tortilla into the air fryer for a few minutes. 

If you want, top with salsa, sour cream, cheese, or whatever ungodly concoction you like! Jelly beans?

[1] Those of you who actually know how to cook Mexican cuisine, forgive me for my ignorance, but I just figured out something about tortillas. I guess this is kind of obvious, but I'm dumb. 

I was sick and tired of the filling falling out of the end while I ate it, so I started doing *this* after scooping the filling in: rolling it up halfway and then tucking both ends inside the roll; then rolling it up the rest of the way. The cooking process fuses everything together and you get little caps on the end.
