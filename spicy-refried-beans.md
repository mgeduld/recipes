## Ingredients 

* 2 15.5oz cans of no salt added pinto beans (1 can drained/left whole + 1 can pureed with liquid)
* 3 Tbsp salsa
* 1 Tbsp mushroom powder (OPTIONAL)
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (OPTIONAL – leave out if you don’t want it spicy)
* salt to taste (OPTIONAL)

## Instructions 

1. Start with one can of no salt added pinto beans and all of their liquid (don’t drain or rinse this can). Pour the entire can (including liquid) into a food processor or blender. Add the salsa and blend until smooth. We use a stick immersion blender for this part and blend directly in the sauce pan, but any food processor or blender will work.
2. Then drain/rinse your second can of pinto beans. Add both the pureed bean/salsa mixture and the whole, rinsed beans to a medium sauce pan on medium heat. 
3. As the pan heats up, add the remaining ingredients. 
4. Mushroom powder is optional, so no big deal if you leave it out! We make ours by grinding up dried mushrooms in our spice/coffee grinder (don’t use the same one you use for coffee, unless you want coffee-flavored powder OR mushroom-flavored coffee). 
5. The cayenne will make it spicy, so adjust to your taste! 
6. After everything is combined, partially cover your sauce pan and bring to a simmer, adjusting the temperature as necessary. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
7. During the simmering process, it can get a bit messy since the beans tend to splatter. We like to a put a lid on, but leave a gap on the side for the steam to escape since you do want some liquid to evaporate from the mixture as it cooks. 
8. After 10 minutes, remove from the heat and let it cool. It will thicken as it cools! 

Store in a glass container in your refrigerator for 4-5 days and enjoy!
