Source: https://plantbasedcookingshow.com/2020/12/12/vegan-zuppa-toscana-soup/

## Ingredients
* 1 large yellow onion, diced
* 6 cups yukon gold or russet potatoes, cubed
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 6 cups kale, chopped (or frozen spinach)
* 1 teaspoon thyme
* 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 1/2 teaspoon pepper
* 1/2 cup nutritional yeast
* 2 liters vegetable stock
* 1/4 cup low-sodium Tamari (my addition)

optional:
* 1/2 cup cashews
* 2 cups water

## Instructions
1. Saut√© the onions until they are translucent.
2. Add the garlic and the kale and cook down for 5 minutes.
3. Add the spices. Chop or crush the fennel seeds first.
4. Add the potatoes and broth and cook on medium high until potatoes are soft, about 20 minutes.
5. Stir in the nutritional yeast.
6. If you want to make it creamy: Blend the cashews and water and add to the soup.
7. Let it cook for another 5 minutes

NOTES: I added a quarter cup of low-sodium Tamari. This soup tasted much better (delicious, in fact) after sitting on the counter for an hour after it was done cooking.
