2. Stir in corn and beans; cook 5 minutes or until heated through, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat. If desired, stir in nutritional yeast. Season with salt. 
3. In a dry nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm tortillas one at a time 40 seconds or until warm and pliable, turning once. Cover with a damp cloth to keep warm.
