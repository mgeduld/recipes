# Cashew Butter

Source: unknown

I like to stuff this in whole-wheat pita pockets

## INGREDIENTS:
* 2 cups raw cashews
* 1/4 cup raw sunflower seeds
* 1/2 cup cooked garbanzo beans
* 2 tablespoons raisins
* 3-5 tablespoons unsweetened soy, hemp or almond milk

## INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Toast cashews at 350 degrees F until very lightly browned, about 5 minutes, stirring after 3 minutes. 
2. Place in food processor and process to the consistency of a coarse powder. 
3. Add remaining ingredients and process until smooth and spreadable. Stop the food processor and scrape down the sides as needed. 

Store refrigerated. 

Serving Suggestion: Spread on 100% whole grain bread and top with sliced apples, bananas or strawberries.
