## Ingredients

* TWO 12 oz bags brussels sprouts (weigh 573 grams AFTER you trim them)
* 4 teaspoons (20g) low-sodium soy sauce (see NOTE)
* 1 tablespoon (20g) pure maple syrup
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* salt (optional)

## Instructions
 
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C) and line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
2. Trim the bottoms of each brussels sprout and pull off any of the outer leaves that are gross looking or too brown or spotty. I buy the 12 oz bags that are already pre-washed and trimmed, but still found several leaves that needed removing and trimmed all the bottoms so they were as fresh as possible.
3. If you don't buy yours pre-washed in a bag, then you will need to rinse them and make sure to really pat them dry before making.
4. After you have trimmed and discarded any outer leaves, cut them in half. THIS is when you will weigh the 573 grams and the sauce will be the perfect amount to soak fully into the brussels sprouts. Keep rotating the bag until they absorb all the sauce.
5. Make the sauce by combining the soy sauce, maple syrup, chili powder and garlic powder in a small bowl. Stir until smooth.
6. Add the trimmed brussels sprouts to a large ziplock bag and pour the sauce over them. I like how they coat well in a bag, but use a bowl if you prefer, just make sure to coat them well. Seal the bag and shake vigorously and massage the bag to ensure all of the brussels sprouts are well coated and absorb every bit of that sauce. If you accurately weighed your brussels sprouts, there should not be ANY residual sauce.
7. If you have any residual sauce, then scoop out the brussels sprouts and place them on the lined pan. You DON'T want to pour any extra sauce onto the pan, as the puddle of sauce will burn. Your pan should look like my photo before baking. Since these are oil-free, that will make the extra sauce burn on the pan. They bake up perfectly soaked onto the brussels sprouts though.
8. Spread out the brussels sprouts evenly so they are not overlapping, doesn't matter which way they are facing up, I did about half and half and they all baked perfectly. Sprinkle salt over the top (1/4-1/2 teaspoon). I found this extra bit of salt made them perfect after baking. Do not worry about it tasting too salty before baking, as the brussels sprouts really absorb the flavors.
9. Bake 15-20 minutes until just charred and fork tender. These cook FASTER than those made with oil. NOW, here's the thing, depending on the size of your brussels sprouts, that will affect how long they take to cook and be tender. Mine were rather big, 1 to 1 1/2 inches wide. Mine were perfectly fork tender with gorgeous just charred bottoms, as you can see in the photos, at about 20 minutes. If yours are small, yours may only take 15 minutes. Set the time for 15 minutes and then check a couple of them with a fork. If the fork easily goes in and is tender, they are done. If they still feel a bit stiff, let them go a couple more minutes. Be careful about overbaking them, as since these are oil-free, they can go from done to burnt.

## Notes

For the soy sauce, you can also sub with low-sodium tamari for gluten-free or liquid aminos. If allergic to soy, you can try coconut aminos, but please keep in mind that it is much sweeter and less salty than soy sauce, so it won't have quite the same flavor. You may need to add more salt, to taste, after baking.
