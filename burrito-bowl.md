## Mexican Black Beans

### Ingredients

- 2 (15-ounce/425g) cans black beans, undrained*

Sofrito
- 1 small red or yellow onion, diced
- 4 garlic cloves, chopped
- 1 jalapeño or serrano pepper, diced**
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 ½ teaspoons dried Mexican oregano
- ½ teaspoon chipotle chile flakes or red pepper flakes***
- 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
- Freshly cracked black pepper
- 1 pound (454g) fresh tomatoes or 1 (14-ounce/400g) can of diced tomatoes
- veggie stock for saute
- liquid aminos/tamari
 
Finishing
- A squeeze or two of lime juice
- 1 cup (16g) fresh cilantro leaves and stems, chopped

### Instructions

1. Don’t drain the beans!
2. Prep the fresh tomatoes, if using. Wash, and then add to a food processor and pulse until pureed. Or grate the tomatoes using the wide holes of a box grater.
3. Make the sofrito. Heat a large sauté pan over medium heat with a little veggie stock. Once hot, add the onion with a aminos/tamari and cook until the onion has softened and is golden but not browned, 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic, jalapeño, cumin, oregano, and chipotle flakes (if using) and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
4. Add the diced tomatoes. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain a rapid simmer and cook until the tomatoes break down and most of the liquid has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with cracks of black pepper.
5. Pour the black beans with their liquid into the sofrito. Bring to a simmer and simmer for 15 minutes until thickened and saucy. If it gets too thick, add a splash of vegetable broth if you have it, or water.
6. Stir i a squeeze of lime juice, and cilantro.

## Sofritas

### Ingredients

- 1 poblano pepper or green bell pepper, kept whole
- 1 medium yellow or red onion, finely chopped
- 4 garlic cloves, chopped
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon Mexican oregano or regular oregano
- ½ teaspoon ancho chile powder
- liquid aminos/tamari
- A generous amount of freshly cracked black pepper
- 1 (12 to 16-ounce) block of super firm tofu (also sold as high-protein tofu)*
- 2 roma tomatoes, chopped
- 1 chipotle pepper in adobo + 1/2 tablespoon adobo sauce**
- 2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
- ½ cup (120 mL) water
- Lime juice to finish

### Instructions

1. Broil the poblano pepper or green bell pepper. 
  You have two options; the gas flame gets you a smokier flavor. No need to peel or remove the seeds when done.
    a. Broiler: Arrange an oven rack 6 inches underneath the broiler flame. Lightly oil the whole poblano pepper. Add the pepper to a sheet pan and broil for 5 minutes, flip, and repeat. Allow to cool a bit, then remove the stem and seeds inside.
    b. Gas flame: Cut the stem off from the pepper. Turn a gas burner to high heat. Use metal tongs to arrange the pepper on top of the flame. Using tongs, turn the pepper occasionally, about every minute, until the skin on all sides is blackened and blistered, about 4 minutes total, but do not allow it to turn to white ash or catch fire.
2. Cook the aromatics in veggie stock and liquid aminos/tamari. Add the onions. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, or until just starting to get some color. Add garlic and cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently. Add tomato paste, cumin, oregano, chile powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, and pepper and cook for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and cook until they’ve softened, about 5 minutes. Clean out the pan.
3. While the onions are cooking, cut the tofu into 4 slabs. Squeeze out as much water as you can. Crumble tofu into small pieces, about the size of a blueberry. 
4. Transfer the onion-tomato mixture to a blender or food processor. Add the broiled poblano pepper, chipotle peppers in adobo, vinegar, and water. Blend until relatively smooth. Taste the sauce, adding any sweetener as needed or more vinegar or liquid aminos/tamari.
5. In a little veggie stock and aminos/tamari, cook the tofu. Add it to the pan spread out in a single packed layer. Allow to cook 2 to 3 minutes undisturbed. Flip and continue cooking for a total of 12 minutes, stirring only every 2 to 3 minutes, until most of the tofu is browned.
6. Pour in the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. It’ll start to thicken, so turn the heat to medium or medium-low and cook for another 5 minutes, or until flavors have developed and tofu is saucy. If it gets too thick, add a few splashes of water.
7. Taste, adjusting seasonings as needed. Finish with a squeeze of lime juice.

## Fajita Veggies

- Freshly cracked black pepper

### Instructions
- In veggie stock and salt substitute (e.g. liquid aminos), stir-fry veggies for 8 - 10 minutes until onions start to carmelize. Use more stock to deglaze the pan.
