Source: https://krocksinthekitchen.com/2020/08/30/recipe-creamy-poblano-corn-chowder-vegan-plant-based-soup/

## Ingredients
*  1/2 cup raw, unsalted cashews (*optional – see note below)
* 2 cups unsweetened plain almond milk
* 2 cups carrot juice
* 2 Tbsp white miso (*optional – see note below)
* 1 medium yellow onion, diced
* 1 red pepper, diced
* 2 tsp minced garlic (approx. 3 cloves) or 1 tsp garlic powder
*  2 x 16oz bags of frozen corn (thawed)
* 1 or 2 poblano peppers (seeded and finely diced)
*  OPTIONAL: Salt and pepper to taste

## Directions
1. Make sure your blender is completely dry. Add cashews and pulse just until a fine powder is formed, being careful not to over blend. With our Vitamix, this process only takes about 15-20 seconds.
2. Add in almond milk, carrot juice and white miso. Blend until everything is fully incorporated. Leave the mixture in the blender and set aside.
3. Heat a large pot or Dutch oven on medium to medium-high.
4. Water sauté diced onion and red pepper until soft and the onions take on some color.
5. Add in garlic and cook for another minute.
6. Add in 3/4 of the corn (24oz), reserving the remaining 1/4 (8oz) to add in later. Heat through.
7. Add cooked ingredients into the cashew, almond milk and carrot juice mixture and blend until smooth. Set aside. IMPORTANT NOTE: Not all blenders have the proper ventilation to blend hot ingredients. Be sure to let the mixture cool first if necessary. *See notes below for alternate method.
8. In the pot or Dutch oven, water sauté the finely diced poblanos until softened.
9. Add in reserved corn and the blender mixture.
10. Reduce heat to low and simmer until heated through, about 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Enjoy!

## RECIPE NOTES:
*  Cashews are optional, but they add an extra creaminess to the soup, so we recommend adding them!
*  The white miso is also optional. We used it as a salt substitute in this recipe, but you can also just use a bit of salt or leave it out.
*  Instead of transferring the cooked onion, pepper, garlic and corn mixture to the blender, you can add the blended cashew, almond milk and carrot juice mixture directly to your pot or Dutch oven and use an immersion blender to blitz everything together. The soup will not be quite as smooth, but it does work quite well! In this case, you’ll need to heat a separate saucepan to cook your poblanos. Be sure to still reserve 1/4 of the corn to add in after using the immersion blender.
