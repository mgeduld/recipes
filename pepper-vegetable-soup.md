## Ingredients

- Four shallots, roughly chopped
- 1 head of garlic, peeled and roughly chopped
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- three russet potatoes, diced
- 6 carrots, sliced
- 6 celery stalks, sliced
- 1 bunch of green onions, sliced
- half a head of shredded cabbage
- 10.5 cups of low-sodium vegggie broth
- 1 tbsb white pepper (this gives it quite a kick!)
- 1/4 tsb nutmeg 
- Salt to taste or, if you're me, 3 tbsp low-sodium Tamari

Optional: cooked chick-pea pasta or cooked rice. 

## Directions
  
1. Sautéing shallot and garlic in a pan. I use water to sauté them in (or a little veggie broth), not oil. When water sautéing, you only need a little liquid. Add more as needed if the veggies start sticking to the pan.
2. Once they're translucent and fragrant, put them in a blender with a little water to create a paste and pour it into the bottom of a large pot or dutch oven.
3. Add the white pepper powder and nutmeg powder to the puree and sauté until mixed.
4. Add the veggie broth and salt or tamari. Bring it to a boil. 
5. While wating for the pot to boil, sauté the yellow onions (in a little water or veggie broth) until they're translucent. 
7. Add the rest of the vegetables to the pot--except for the green onions and cabbage.
8. Simmer on medium for 30 minutes.
9. Add in the cabbage. Simmer for another 15 minutes.
10. While waiting for the soup to finish, water sauté the green onions, blend them into a puree, and the pour it into the soup, mixing well. Or you can drizzle it on top.
11. Optionally add in a container of cooked chickpea pasta or pour the soup over rice.
