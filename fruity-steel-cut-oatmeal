# Fruity Steel-cut Oatmeal

Source: unknown

This is my go-to breakfast cereal. I put some in a bowl, add plant milk, and microwave for two minutes

## Ingredients
* six very overripe bananas (the more overripe, the sweeter the result!)
* Two cups of frozen fruit. I usually use a cup of blueberries, some strawberries, and some peaches
* Two cups of steel-cut oats
* 1 tbsp cinnamon
* 1 tsp nutmeg
* 2 tsp alcohol-free vanilla extract
* 9 cups of water

## Directions

1. Slice up six bananas and put them in a large pot. 
2. Add in some frozen fruit. I usually add two cups of wild blueberries, some strawberries, and/or some peaches. 
3. Cover with nine cups of water. Bring to boil and let boil for five minutes, tending the pot so that it doesn’t boil over. 
4. Add in two cups of oats, a tablespoon of cinnamon, a teaspoon of nutmeg, and two teaspoons of alcohol-free vanilla extract
5. Cook for 25 minutes (on high heat), **stirring continually**. Steel-cut oats take longer to cook than instant oatmeal. You have to keep stirring or it will burn and stick to the bottom.
