# Marcus Burgers

This is work in progress. It's been challenging for me to find a vegan burger recipe I've liked. But of the 15 or so I've tried, I like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Eat-Live-Quick-Easy-Cookbook/dp/0062684957/ref=sr_1_3?crid=18UHXMQVLMXU5&dchild=1&keywords=eat+to+live+cookbook&qid=1612807930&sprefix=eat+to+live+co%2Caps%2C158&sr=8-3)

Below is my current modification of it, with notes at the bottom for next time:

## Ingredients
* 1 baked sweet potato, mashed (prick with fork; bake 1 hour at 400 degrees)
* 1/3 cup raw cashews
* 1/3 cup raw walnuts
* 1/3 cup lentils
* 1/3 cup rolled oats
* 1/2 cup diced red onion
* 1/2 jalapeno pepper, deseeded and diced
* 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro
* 3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
* 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
* 2 tablespoons low-sodium tamari, soy sauce, or liquid amino acid
* 1 tablespoon cider vinegar
* 1 tablespoon mustard
* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon smoked parika
* 1 teaspoon liquid smoke
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

* small amount of cooking spray

Note: instead of cooking spray, I but a [silicone mat](https://www.amazon.com/GRIDMANN-Pro-Silicone-Baking-Mat/dp/B06XX5LYCC/ref=sr_1_6?crid=1TF8RS5JTDV67&dchild=1&keywords=silicone+baking+mats&qid=1612807770&sprefix=silicone+bak%2Caps%2C187&sr=8-6) on baking trays

## Instructions 
1. Preheat oven to 350
2. Place nuts in food processor and grind to a fine powder. 
3. Add remaining ingredients and pulse to combine. 
4. Form mixture into burgers, place on sprayed baking pan, and bake for 30 minutes. 

## Notes

This was good but a bit too sweet for my tastes. Next time I'll add half the amount of sweet potato and 1 cup cooked black beans (which were in the original recipe). I may up the mustard to 2 tablespoons.
