Sweet, spicy, tangy, and simply lovely. Very few ingredients for an extraordinarily delicious, nutritious way to up the ante of eating more veggies.

## Ingredients

* 1/4 cup raw cashews
* 3 tbsp ketchup
* 3 tbsp nutritional yeast
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika 
* 2 tbsp lime juice (about 1 lime)
* 1/2 cup unsweetened, plain almond/soy milk
* 1 red bell pepper, top (stem removed) and bottom

## Instructions

1. Prepare the dressing by adding all the dry ingredients in the mix to the nuts and pulsing until a fine powder. Stop short of the oil being released from the cashew and forming a nut butter. Add the bell pepper ends, ketchup, lime juice, and plant milk and blend until creamy/smooth. If too thick/thin then it can be adjusted with a little more/less nut milk or a little water. It should be close with a half cup. 
2. Pour dressing over any salad, cooked vegetables, baked potato, whole grain pasta, or any other veggie-loaded dish.
