Note: this makes a small amout. I trippled it with success! 

## Ingredients

* 1 cup corn flour 
* 1 cup oat flour
* 1 cup water or plant-based milk
* ¼ cup unsweetened applesauce
* 2-3 tablespoons maple syrup
* 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* ½ to 1 teaspoon salt 

## Directions
1. In a mediuim sized mixing bowl add in the corn flour, oat flour, baking soda, and salt.
2. Stir together so that all of the dry ingredients are evenly combined. 
3. In another bowl mix together the wet ingredients. 
4. Mix the wet and dry ingredients together so that there are no clumps of flour left hiding in the batter. 
5. Pour the batter into a baking dish. It will double it's height while baking, so make sure there's room.
6. Bake at 385℉ for 30 to 40 minutes. 
7. Check at 30 minutes and if a toothpick or knife can be poked into the center of the cornbread and come out cleanly it is ready. If the toothpick still has some batter on it, place it back into the oven for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.
