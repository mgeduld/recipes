What I love about this dressing is that there's no blender or food-processor involved. Just mix the ingredients together with a whisk or spoon and you're done! 

* 4 heaping tbsp tahini
* 1 lemon (juice) 
* 1 tbsp maple syrup (or date) 
* 1 tbsp spicy brown mustard (or whatever mustard you have)
* 1/3 cup warm water
* Salt/Pepper to taste

Whisk or blend until smooth
