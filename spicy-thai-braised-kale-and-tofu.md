Source: https://www.drfuhrman.com/lifestyle/recipes/1716

## INGREDIENTS:

* 16 ounces firm tofu, drained well, cut into 1 inch cubes
* 1 cup finely chopped onion
* 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
* 1 small jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
* 1 teaspoon chili powder
* 2 cups no-salt-added or low-sodium vegetable broth
* 1/2 cup unsalted, natural peanut butter
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste (see note)
* 2 tablespoons Dr. Fuhrman's MatoZest (or other no-salt seasoning blend, adjusted to taste)
* 1 bunch kale, tough stems and center ribs removed and leaves chopped
* 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
* 4 scallions, thinly sliced

## INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Place tofu cubes on a lightly-oiled baking dish and bake for 30 minutes, turning after 15 minutes.
2. Heat a large saute pan and add onion, ginger, and jalapeno. Cook until onion has softened, adding 1-2 teaspoons of water as needed to prevent sticking. Add chili powder and cook one more minute.
3. Whisk in vegetable broth, peanut butter, tomato paste, MatoZest and bring to a boil. Gradually add kale a few handfuls at a time, stirring to let it wilt down. Add baked tofu, cover, reduce heat, and simmer for 15 minutes or until kale is tender. Stir in lime juice and top with sliced scallions.
