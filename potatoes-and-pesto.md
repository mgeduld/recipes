Source: https://krocksinthekitchen.com/2020/10/02/recipe-roasted-pesto-potatoes-vegan-plant-based-oil-free/

## Ingredients
* 2 to 3 medium Russet Potatoes
* 1 Tbsp pine nuts, toasted
* 1 cup frozen peas, thawed
* 1/2 to 3/4 cup fresh basil
* 2 cloves garlic
* 2 tsp lemon juice
* 1 Tbsp low sodium Tamari
* 1/4 cup unsweetened original almond milk
* Pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
2. Clean the potatoes and dice into one-inch cubes (leave skins on).
3. Spread out potato cubes on a baking tray lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Bake for 45 minutes or until golden brown, stirring every 15 minutes.
4. Heat a small pan or skillet to medium-low. Add pine nuts and stir/shake continuously until they just start to turn golden brown and become fragrant, about 15 to 30 seconds. Remove from pan immediately and let cool. Be careful not to burn them! If you burn them, Brian says to start over. They will be extremely bitter.
5. Add toasted pine nuts, thawed peas, basil, garlic, lemon juice, Tamari, almond milk and pepper to a food processor. Process until it reaches a creamy consistency. You will need to scrape down the sides a few times during this process.
6. Serve with pesto on top of potatoes and enjoy!
