## Ingredients
* 1¼ cups chickpea flour
* ¼ teaspoon baking powder
* ¼ teaspoon dried turmeric
* 1 tablespoon no-salt seasoning or your choice of dried herbs
* 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast, optional
* 1¼ cup water, plus more if necessary to achieve a pourable consistency
* 2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (optional)
* 1 shallot, minced
* ¼ cup chopped mushrooms
* 2 handfuls of baby kale, chopped finely
* Coconut oil spray, optional
* Sea salt, optional, for topping

## Instructions
1. Combine chickpea flour, baking powder, dried turmeric, no-salt seasoning or dried herbs, and nutritional yeast in a medium-sized bowl. Add water and lemon juice and use a whisk to stir together, getting rid of any clumps.
2. Stir in minced shallot, chopped mushroom, and chopped kale. The consistency of the batter should be pourable and not too thick. Add 1-2 tablespoons of water and stir again, if necessary, to achieve the proper consistency.
3. Spray a medium skillet lightly with coconut oil and heat on medium. You can use two skillets if you want to make and serve both omelets at the same time.
4. Pour half the batter into your skillet. Place a lid over the pan to help it cook faster. Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the omelet cook for 3-4 minutes.
5. Once the top of the omelet has started to cook, use a spatula or a plate to help flip the omelet onto the other side. If your batter sticks, then you can always make it into a scramble, using a spatula to scrape the batter off the bottom of the pan.
6. Reduce the heat to low, place the lid on the pan, and let it cook for another 4-5 minutes (if making a scramble version, then it will cook faster, maybe another 2-3 minutes).
7. Serve hot, topped with a bit of sea salt, if desired.
