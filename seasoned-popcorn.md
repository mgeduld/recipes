Source: https://krocksinthekitchen.com/2019/07/21/oil-free-popcorn-tips-chili-cheez-popcorn-recipe-vegan/

## Ingredients 
* 1/4 cup popcorn kernels
* 10-15 sprays of Braggâ€™s Liquid Aminos

## Chili Cheez Seasoning Mix
* 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast
* 1/2 tsp chili powder
* 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp cumin
*  1/4 tsp salt (OPTIONAL)

## Instructions 
1. Measure all of the ingredients for the seasoning mix into a spice/coffee grinder or mortar & pestle. Grind until you have a fine powder.
2. Place 1/4 cup popcorn kernels into your air popper and pop! If possible, pop your popcorn into a bowl that has a tight fitting lid.
3. Immediately after it pops, spray the popcorn with Liquid Aminos (approx. 10-15 sprays). You will want a nice, even coating so your seasoning mix will stick.
4. Coat with a generous portion of your seasoning mix. You will not need the entire mix for 1/4 cup of popcorn kernels, so save any extras in a sealed container for next time!
5. Secure the lid on your bowl (if possible) and shake the popcorn up vigorously until evenly coated.
