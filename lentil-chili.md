## ingredients

### Date Paste
- 9 deglet dates
- 1 cup water
OR
- ¼ cup WYW Date Powder

### Chili
- 2¼ cups red lentils
- 5½ cups water
- 2 15 oz. cans diced tomatoes
- 1 6 oz. can tomato paste
- 1 10-12 oz. bag frozen chopped onion (or 1 medium diced)
- 1 10-12 oz. bag frozen green bell pepper (or 2 fresh diced)
- 1 10-12 oz. bag frozen sliced mushrooms (or fresh)
- 2 tablespoons minced garlic
- ¼ cup apple cider vinegar
- ¼ cup WYW Nutritional Yeast
- 2 tablespoons dried parsley
- 2 tablespoons dried oregano
- 2 tablespoons chili powder
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 2 teaspoons chipotle powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon black pepper
- ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper (optional)

## instructions

1. Blend the dates and water on high until smooth, if using.
2. Add the date paste/powder to a 6 quart Instant Pot, along with all of the other ingredients.
3. Stir to mix it up. Close the pot and cook on high pressure for 10-12 minutes, manual release. For a creamier texture, go longer as this will cause the red lentils to fall apart. For a more lentily texture, just do the 10 minutes.

This dish also works great in a pot on the stove. Just bring everything to a boil and then reduce the heat and simmer for 20-30 minutes or until it reaches your desired texture. Likewise, this works great in the slow cooker, set to low for about 8 hours.

Serve on a bed of greens, rice, or baked potatoes. Enjoy!
