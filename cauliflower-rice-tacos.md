## "Meat" Ingredients
* 4 cups riced cauliflower
* 1 tbsp smoked paprika
* 1 tbsp chili powder
* 1/2 tbsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tbsp onion powder
* 1 tsp cumin
* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* hot sauce (optional)

## Meat Instructions
1. Heat up a skillet (I used a wok) on medium high heat with a bit of water in the bottom. I used a teaspoon of water and when it was bubbling, I added the rest of the ingredients. 
2. Add the riced cauliflower, smoked paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin.  Mix.  
3. Add the soy sauce and hot sauce and continue to saut√© for 5-7min.

## Other Ingredients
* Corn tortillas
* greens
* sweet corn
* red onions

The original recipe also suggested diced tomatoes, cilantro, pico and/or salsa.

## Taco Instructions
1. In a flat skillet, heat the tortillas, flipping every minute or so until you see small brown spots on both sides. 
2. Pack with "meat" and other ingredients of your choice. 

Note: I highly recommend getting taco holders. I've been trying to make tacos without them for years, and it's always a royal pain in the ass. These things make it simple and fun.
